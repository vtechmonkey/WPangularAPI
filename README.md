# angular-wordpress-seed

A bare-bones AngularJS blog app designed to work with the Wordpress [JSON REST API](http://wp-api.org).

## Demo

http://www.michaelbromley.co.uk/experiments/angular-wordpress-seed/

## Setting Up Wordpress

1. Download and install Wordpress ([Download link](https://wordpress.org/download/))
2. Enable pretty permalinks (`Settings -> Permalinks`), select "custom structure" and use the string `/%post_id%/%postname%`.
3. Install the [**JSON REST API (WP-API)**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/) plugin. Easiest way is to use the `Plugins -> Add New` feature of the Wordpress
admin interface. Manual install instructions can be found on the [WP-API repo](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API#installation).
4. By default, the [AngularJS service that communicates with Wordpress](src/app/common/services/BlogService.js) will look for posts with a category of "post". Additionally,
posts which are also in the category "featured" will appear on the home page. These categories will therefore need to be set up.

## Setting Up The Client

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install` and `bower install` to download the dependencies.
3. Configure your paths and meta data in the `config.json` file of the root directory.
3. Run `gulp watch` to build and start the watch task.
4. Navigate to the `/build` directory in your browser to test.
5. Upload the contents of `/dist` to your production server.

## Developing

Here is an outline of the folder structure:

```
./src
   |- app               // The Angular app itself.
   |   |- about         // The various sections are in their
   |   |- blog          // own folders, and the `common` folder
   |   |- common        // houses any shared components & services
   |   |- home
   |
   |- assets            // Any static assets such as images and icon fonts.
   |- less              // All styling for the app. Each section has its own
                        // .less file, which are imported into the main.less file.

./build                 // dev build created when Gulp is run
./dist                  // minified, concatenated distribution build created by Gulp.
```


## Extras

* Simple, responsive CSS based on the [Pure CSS framework](http://purecss.io/).
* A couple of custom directives are included for simple pagination of blog posts and a revealing search input.
* Built-in support for handling search-engine and social-media crawlers based on [this technique](https://github.com/michaelbromley/angular-social-demo)
